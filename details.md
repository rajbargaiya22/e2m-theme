Hello Dhwani,

I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to inform you that I have successfully completed the task. Below are the relevant links:

    Theme Link: Download Theme

    Theme Screenshot (After Development): Screenshot

    Metafields Created for Next Workshop (Post-Type: 'next-workshop'): Metafields

    Metafields Created for Stage 1 and Stage 2 Posts (Post-Type: 'post'): Metafields

Steps to Set Up the Theme:

    Install and activate the theme.
    Create a home page and assign the template "RJ Homepage."
    Set it as the Home page from the settings.
    For Stage 1 and Stage 2 sections, create posts to display these sections.
    For the next workshop, I added the post type (programmatically, without a plugin) named "next-workshop."
